# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values

This example demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values.

The `$in` operator is typically used to match a field against any value in a provided array.  However, when `null` is present in the array, the behavior might not be as expected, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.

**Bug:**
The provided `bug.js` file shows an example of an incorrect query that uses `$in` with a `null` value in the array.  This query may not function as anticipated.

**Solution:**
The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a solution to this problem, by correctly handling `null` values.  If the intention is to include documents where the field is null, then an explicit check for null should be added to the query.
